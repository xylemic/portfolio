    <div class="about-me">
          <p>
            Hey there! üëã I'm Daniel, a passionate learner who's diving
            headfirst into the exciting world of web development. With a
            background in civil engineering and a bachelor's degree under my
            belt, I've always been drawn to problem-solving and building things
            from scratch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I'm on a journey to master both frontend and backend
            technologies through a rigorous bootcamp program. From crafting
            beautiful user interfaces to building robust server-side
            applications, I'm constantly pushing myself to learn and grow in
            this dynamic field.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not glued to my computer screen, you'll probably find me on
            the football pitch, either watching or playing the beautiful game.
            As a die-hard fan of Chelsea FC, I never miss a match and love
            nothing more than cheering on my favorite team to victory. But my
            interests don't stop there! I'm also fascinated by the mysteries of
            space and the wonders of the universe. Whether it's watching
            awe-inspiring documentaries or devouring articles on the latest
            space discoveries, I can't get enough of exploring the cosmos.
          </p>
          <p>
            And when it comes to downtime, I enjoy indulging in the occasional
            movie binge. While I may not be a hardcore movie buff, I appreciate
            a good film and love getting lost in captivating stories on the big
            screen. But perhaps my greatest passion lies in coding. In my free
            time, you'll often find me experimenting with new coding challenges
            and working on small web projects. There's nothing quite like the
            thrill of bringing ideas to life through code and seeing them come
            to fruition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh, and did I mention? My favorite Formula 1 driver is none other
            than the legendary Lewis Hamilton. üèéüí® Thanks for stopping by and
            taking the time to get to know me a little better. Feel free to
            reach out‚ÄîI'm always up for a chat about coding, football, or
            anything in between!
          </p>
